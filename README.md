# cattoblog

- Cattoblog - Cattone is a basic personal bog website. You can add post, read the posts, add category, find posts by category, add a comment,...

- In this project i was using MongoDB as database, MongoDB API monk to connect to the database, NodeJS, Express framework, Jade(Pug) for the front-end,...

- The "contact" and "search" is not actually work, i will make those functions in the future and maybe i will do the authentication function too.

==============MY NOTES FOR NEW GUYS==============
1. Download my project to your personal computer.
2. Install the packages. Open gitbash and type: "npm install" and wait a minute.
3. I was linking the project to my database. If you want to change the link to my database to yours just change the variable below if you see it.

- var db = require('monk')('localhost/mango');

- "mango" is the name of my database.

3. Run the project: "npm start".
4. The project is running on PORT 3000.
5. Go to "localhost:3000" to use the website.

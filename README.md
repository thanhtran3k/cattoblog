# cattoblog

- Cattoblog - Cattone is a basic personal bog website. You can add post, read the posts, add category, find posts by category, add a comment,...

- In this project i was using MongoDB as database, MongoDB API monk to connect to the database, NodeJS, Express framework and Jade(Pug), Bootstrap for the front-end,...

- The "search" function is not actually working, i will make that function in the future and maybe i will do the authentication function too.

- You can re-use my catto_contact for the contact function.

# My notes
1. Download my project to your personal computer.
2. Install the packages. Open gitbash and type: "npm install" and wait a minute.
3. I was linking the project to my database. If you want to change the link to my database to yours just change the variable below if you see it.

- var db = require('monk')('localhost/mango');

- "mango" is the name of my database.

4. Start MongoDB.
5. Run the project: "npm start".
6. The project is running on PORT 3000.
7. Go to "localhost:3000" to use the website.
8. I can't upload all of my template to github, you should customize one or contact me, i will send mine to your email.
9. Contact me if you're in troubles.
